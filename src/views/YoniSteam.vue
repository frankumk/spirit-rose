        Yoni is a sanskrit word, literally meaning female genitalia, but 
        it also is used to refer to womb, origin, source. Yoni Steaming is
       an ancient way of Being Water. Blessing and cleansing our Sacred 
       Waters within, we create a sacred space to connect to our womb portal. 
       Using blessed herbs from my garden, infused within the steaming water, 
       we invite plant spirit and her physical constituents to enter our womb. 
       An important way to release tension, which is a common source of dis-ease 
       in our pelvic area. An efficient way to absorb plant medicine. A space for transformation.

      Regular Yoni steams hold the potential to heal many imbalances of our 
      sacred womb space including: endometriosis, fibroids, PMS, PMDD, anxiety, 
      depressive feelings, lack of creation energy, low libido, BV, sexual traumas, 
      lack of self confidence.

      Post Partum Yoni Steam is imperative to healing physically and spiritually. 
      I would love to come to your home and prepare a sacred steam for you in this 
      intimate time of healing and expansion into motherhood.
