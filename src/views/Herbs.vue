            What herbs do I use? I use solely herbs grown from my garden or the garden 
            of my beloved earth care takers. They are only organic and most are sung to 
            and connected to spiritually. At Spirit Rose, we mostly work with Rose Medicine 
            from my garden! But, with your herbalist, together we can create a balanced blend
            for what you are seeking.
